    <h1>Self-Introduction - <span class="highlight">Aashish Pal</span></h1>
    <p>Good morning Sir and Ma’am,</p>

    <p>My name is <strong>Aashish Pal</strong>. I belong to <strong>Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh</strong>, and I currently live in <strong>Meethapur, New Delhi</strong>.</p>

    <p>I have completed my <strong>matric studies (Class 10)</strong> in 2025 from <strong>Thakur S.P.S.M.H.S.B., Bhanpura</strong>, under the Uttar Pradesh Board of High School and Intermediate Education.</p>

    <p>After that, I enrolled in a <strong>Diploma in Computer Science Engineering</strong> at <strong>ACMT Group of Colleges, Badarpur, Delhi</strong>. I am currently in the <strong>1st semester</strong> of my diploma program.</p>

    <p>I chose this field because I’m curious about how computers work and how technology shapes our world. I’m excited to explore subjects like programming and networking as I continue my studies.</p>

    <p>My hobbies include <strong>gaming</strong> and watching <strong>tech vlogs</strong>, especially content related to new technologies and gadgets. I’m always eager to learn new things and enjoy working in a team environment.</p>

    <p>In the future, I plan to pursue a <strong>B.Tech</strong> to deepen my knowledge and build a successful career in the tech field.</p>

    <p>Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself.</p>
